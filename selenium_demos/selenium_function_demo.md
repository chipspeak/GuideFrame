## Step 1
This video serves as a demonstration of guideframe's use of selenium functions. We'll achieve this via the Magneto testing site.


## Step 2
Here, we can demonstrate the function which takes a buttons span text as an argument. In this case, we can click on the agree button within the cookie policy popup.


## Step 3
We can use the click element function by passing in the elements I D. Let's use that to sign in.


## Step 4
We can use the form fields here to demonstrate the type into fields function, which takes the element I D and the text you wish to pass as arguments.


## Step 5
Now that we've filled the form, we can use the click element function again to sign in with these credentials.


## Step 6
Next, we'll demonstrate the hover over element function by hovering over the gear dropdown in the navbar. This function takes an h ref as an argument. It is then used in an X path filter to locate the appropriate element.


## Step 7
We'll once again use the click element function to select the fitness equipment link.


## Step 8
Now we'll hover over the yoga companion kit using the same hovering function.


## Step 9
Then we can move on to hover over the yoga straps.


## Step 10
Then the strength band kit.


## Step 11
Before returning to the yoga straps, this time using the hover and click function in order to first hover, then click on the link.


## Step 12
Next, let's hover over the reviews section on the product page.


## Step 13
We can use the open link in new tab function here to open the reviews section in a new tab and switch to it.


## Step 14
Let's enter some text here using the same function for fields that we did earlier.


## Step 15
Now we can click on the submit review button using the same functionality we've been using throughout.


## Step 16
We can use the switch to tab function to return to the original tab by passing the tab index as an argument.


## Step 17
Now that we're on the original tab, let's click the dropdown in the top right of the screen. We do this by using the click on button via span text function once again.


## Step 18
Finally, let's click the sign out button to end this demonstration.
