## Step 1 
This brief GuideFrame demo begins by opening tutors.dev. This is achieved by using the open u r l function prior to step 1.

## Step 2
We can demonstrate the ability to pass multiple actions to GuideFrame by activating dark mode. This involves 3 calls to the click element function. We'll also call the sleep function for 0.5 seconds between each action.

## Step 3
Now let's use the hover and click function to move to the tutors reference manual.

## Step 4
We can pass None to lambda in order to hang on a page. This is useful for when you wish to simply add voiceover to a static page. Let's use the hover over element function a few times here. We'll also pass the order argument. This ensures that the action begins before the voiceover.

## Step 5
We'll start with the getting started card.

## Step 6
Now let's move on to the simple starter card.

## Step 7
Let's continue to the alternative starter card. Before using the scroll to element function to move to the reference course.

## Step 8
In this case, we use this function to access an element that may not be in the display window.

## Step 9
Let's use the click element by xpath function. We'll use it to access the search bar at the top of the screen.

## Step 10
With the search bar open, let's use the type into field function to type in card.

## Step 11
Let's open the link in the first result in a new tab. We can do this by using the open link in new tab function.

## Step 12
And that concludes this GuideFrame demonstration.
